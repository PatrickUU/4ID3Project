## About

The project utilizes the Arduino Cloud library, further documentation on the platform can be found **[here](https://cloud.arduino.cc/)**.

## Usage

The idea of the project is to simplify the usage process of creating mixed cocktails by inputting a simple phrase of what the user would like. Utilizing a recipe stored within the code, the user can call upon the recipe in the textbox in the Arduino Cloud dashboard. When called upon, the servo motors will open and close specific valves for a set portion of time based on the drink and mix you would like to dispense.

The following libraries are required to achieve the code followed in the main section:

```c++
**INSERT CODE INSERTS HERE***
```

The following code is where recipes would be stored and dispensed:

```c++
**INSERT CODE HERE PLESAEAEAEWESESE*
```

When a user inputs their desired drink - the following message will display in the dashboard:

```c++
 "Your drink is ready!"
```

After this message, the user can then chose another drink to dispense only when a cup is present at the dispense tube.

## Hardware

The project utilizes various hardware components to successfully achieve the end product. The following is a quick BOM to reference:
- High Torque Servo (x4)
- ½" Ball Valves (4)
- ½" Plastic Tubing (10’ roll) (1)
- 3D printed components (4 bottle caps)
- Scrap Wood for Physical Body
- Arduino Maker 1000 (1)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (1)
